Exploring a public dataset in BigQuery

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City. 

This dataset includes Citi Bike trips since Citi Bike launched in September 2013 and is updated daily. The data has been processed by Citi Bike to remove trips that are taken by staff to service and inspect the system, as well as any trips below 60 seconds in length, which are considered false starts.

This public dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery and is included in BigQuery's 1TB/mo of free tier processing. This means that each user receives 1TB of free BigQuery processing every month, which can be used to run queries on this public dataset.
